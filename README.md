a)SERVER FRAMEWORK:
The server framework used here is Ruby. I used ruby because using i never knew ruby and was my first project using it so i got to learn it. Also ruby provides simpler and more human like code. Also ruby is growing with time.

b) CLIENT FRSMEWORK:
Client framework used here is Angular JS. Angular js is comparatively new and have much more efficiency than jquery. USing angular js provides more ways of using data from the server providing ajax support.

c)Aspect of implementation found easy:
The aspect taht was found easy was to plan,implement and to customize all the resources to run the project.

d)Aspect of implementation found difficult:
The aspect that was found difficult was to customize heroku to deploy the app as my app was not deployed successfully because of sqlite3 error.

e)Other components installed were the IDE's that were required to run the project on my machine. 

f)instead of using ubantu commands I directly connected github account to Heroku and directly deployed it.
